# Task Killer
The purpose of this application is a quick fix or my parents. Running certain
games on their computer, they do not close properly and they become unable to
open them again later. The task never shuts down fully. This application is
intended to close the application, with each application having its own force
close. Saves them having to go and do a reboot each time a game doesn't close.

For use, change the notepad.exe section to the actual exe that fails to close,
and then simply run the .bat file anytime the application doesn't shut down
properly. This batch script is intended to be run as a one-kill per file.
